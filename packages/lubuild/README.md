# **LUBuild**
The **LUBuild** tool makes it easy for you to manage working with multiple model definitions among a team members across data centers and languages.

Foreach LU file (and it's language variants) **LUBuild** will
1. if there isn't a LUIS AppId for the model, it will create one
2. it runs ludown tool to generate the model
3. it uploads the model to the appid
4. it trains the model
5. it publishes it
6. it then outputs a .dialog definition of a LuisRecognizer configured to use that model.

## Installation

```npm install -g lubuild```

## Usage
1. create a models.config with **name** and **models** configured to your root .LU files
2. Get LUIS.ai authoringKey
3. invoke 
     
    ```lubuild --authoringKey YOURKEY```

**LUBuild** will create all of the assets you need from your local .LU files

## LU and language varations files
Every LU file can have multiple language variations.  **LUBuild** will build a model for each one.  

The pattern for .LU files and the language variants are
```json
example.en-us.lu
example.fr-fr.lu
example.de-de.lu
etc.
````
Each one of these .lu files will have a language specific model created fo rit.

## LUIS Applications 

Every combination of project, environment, and file name (With locale) will be used
to name the application created on your behalf.

LUIS application names will 
> {projectname}-{environment}-{LUfilename}

Example:
```
    MyProject(tomlm)-Contoso.dialog1.en-us.lu
    MyProject(tomlm)-Contoso.dialog1.fr-fr.lu
    MyProject(tomlm)-Contoso.dialog1.de-de.lu
```
The same application name will be used in each azure region, with endpoints internal to it.

## Generated .Dialog file for each lu file
All language variations of a .LU files with the same prefix will get a .dialog file created
which is a LUIS recognizer configured for it. 

Example:
```
    models/tomlm/westus/Contoso.dialog1.lu.dialog <-- MultiLanguageRecognizer configured to use all of the languages 
    models/tomlm/westus/Contoso.dialog1.en-us.lu.dialog <-- LuisRecognizer 
    models/tomlm/westus/Contoso.dialog1.fr-fr.lu.dialog <-- LuisRecognizer 
    models/tomlm/westus/Contoso.dialog1.de-de.lu.dialog <-- LuisRecognizer 
```

The net reslut is that to consome all of the language models in a dialog you simply can do this:
Example:
```json
{
    "$type":"Microsoft.AdaptiveDialog",
    "recognizer": "Contoso.dialog1.lu"  <-- this will be the multilanguage model with all variations
}
```

This will configure your recognizer to a LURecognizer("Contsoso.Dialog1.lu") which internally
will use your memory *settings.luis.projectname* and *settings.luis.environment* settings to
bind to the correct .dialog file for your model and runtime environment.

## Environments
When multiple people are working with models you want to be able to work with models
independently from each other tied to the source control.  **LUBuild**

By default, **LUBuild** uses the logged in user alias as the enviornment, so that you can
simply create and work with local changes.  

The environment is placed in *settings.luis.environment* configuration to control which
actually application ids you are connected to.

You can override the environment via cli argument *--environment foo* or via the models.config
file.

## Config file
The **luconfig.json** file describes the configuration for **LUBuild**.  Any LU files add to this file 
will be processed by **LUBuild** to create the published models you need to execute against.

```json
{
    "name":"MyProject",
    "defaultLanguage":"en-us",
    "models": [
        "test/test.lu",
        "test/sample/x/Contoso.Foo.lu"
    ]
}
```
Every .LU file which is added to the models collection will be processed by **LUBuild**.

| defaultLanguage |            | configures default language model to use if there is no culture code in the file name (Default:en-us) |

All command line args can be placed in the config file, and vice versa, except for the **models** collection itself
